    <section id='unboxing_and_claims'><h2>Unboxing and Manufacturer Claims</h2><p>The Li-MSK L 1010 is a brushless cordless drill marketed with high specifications, including 80 Nm of torque and 3,500 RPM. The unit features a 13mm chuck diameter and three operating modes: screw, drill, and impact/hammer drill. The torque setting is adjustable up to 20. The packaging initially claimed a 3 AH battery, but the supplied batteries are labeled 2A (2000 mAh).</p></section><section id='measured_performance_discrepancies'><h2>Measured Performance and Specification Gaps</h2><p>Quantitative testing revealed significant discrepancies between claimed and actual performance. RPM measurement showed that Speed 1 reached 383 RPM and Speed 2 reached 1282 RPM, falling far short of the claimed 3,500 RPM. The supplied 2A battery, which uses 2000 mAh cells, was tested to have an actual usable capacity of only 1300 mAh. Furthermore, the 1 amp charger was measured to output a maximum of 0.55 amps during charging.</p></section><section id='practical_drilling_tests'><h2>Practical Drilling Capabilities</h2><p>Despite the inflated specs, the drill demonstrated good power in practical tests. It easily handled a 20mm fan nozzle bit and a 13mm auger bit on Speed 2 (Drill Mode). When challenged with a larger 19mm auger bit, the drill struggled on Speed 2 but was capable of completing the task on Speed 1. The impact mode was tested on concrete, showing capability, although one test noted the tool stopping during use. The unit features a functional single lock mechanism but also includes a decorative button with no actual function.</p></section>
