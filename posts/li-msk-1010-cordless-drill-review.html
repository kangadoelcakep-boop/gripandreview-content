    <section id='unboxing_and_design'><h2>Unboxing and Design Overview</h2><p>The Li-MSK 1010 is a brushless cordless drill. The unit features a 13 mm chuck diameter and three modes: screw, drill, and hammer/impact. The torque setting goes up to 20. The body design incorporates soft rubber on the grip and bottom. However, the logo and specifications are applied using stickers. A notable build flaw is the presence of a non-functional or 'fake' button on the unit, and some loose spacing was observed in the gear shifting mechanism.</p></section><section id='spec_vs_reality'><h2>Major Discrepancies in Claimed Specifications</h2><p>The manufacturer claims a maximum RPM of 3,500. However, testing revealed the actual maximum speed (Speed 2) was only 1282 RPM, and Speed 1 measured 383 RPM, indicating a significant exaggeration of speed capabilities.</p><p>Battery capacity claims were also misleading. While the box claimed 3 AH and the battery unit claimed 2 AH (2000 mAh), a controlled discharge test showed the actual capacity was only 1300 mAh. Furthermore, the wall charger, claimed to be 1 amp, was measured to deliver a maximum current capacity of only 0.55 amps.</p></section><section id='performance_testing'><h2>Drilling Performance Results</h2><p>The drill demonstrated strong performance in wood, easily handling a 20 mm fan nozzle bit and a 13 mm auger bit on Speed 2. When tested with a larger 19 mm auger bit, the drill stalled on Speed 2, though it was capable of completing the task on Speed 1. In impact mode, the drill was capable of drilling into concrete, but it stalled when attempting to drill deeper with a 12mm bit on Speed 2.</p></section>
